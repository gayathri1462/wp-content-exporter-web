## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This project follows the principles of **Balanced Modernity**:
- **Contrast**: Full visual clarity with 1.0 opacity on all essential elements.
- **Structure**: Locked layouts that eliminate page-level scrolling in favor of internal scrolling components.
- **Motion**: Subtle entrance and interaction animations to provide a premium, reactive feel.
